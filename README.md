A set of Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerts written in [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/). This Monitoring following 3 basic design principles:

1. `Intuitive` - Green, orange and red colors signaling whether or not your action is needed
1. `Drill-down` - if you want details why is something green, orange or red, just click it
1. `Relevant information only` - provide only metrics relevant for this particular area of interest and drill-down level, side-by-side with logs (experimental feature)

Monitoring targets are:

| Kubernetes | Hosts (TBD) | Applications (TBD) |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------------:|

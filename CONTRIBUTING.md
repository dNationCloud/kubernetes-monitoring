## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a legally binding statement that asserts that you are the
creator of your contribution, and that you wish to allow dNation Kubernetes Monitoring project to use your work.

Acknowledgement of this permission is done using a sign-off process in Git.
The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. The
text of the DCO is available on [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/).

If you are willing to agree to these terms, you just add a line to every git
commit message:

`Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>`

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` as part of your git
configuration, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

Unfortunately, you have to use your real name (i.e., pseudonyms or anonymous
contributions cannot be made). This is because the DCO is a legally binding
document, granting the dNation Kubernetes Monitoring project to use your work.
